Colony `avatar selector`
===

## Controls

* `space` to open the selector.
* `left` or `right` arrow to choose.
* `enter` to select.

## Testing

To test this beautiful `avatar selector`, run either `yarn test` or `npm test` in your terminal of choice.

It's not exactly unit-tests, but e2e-tests, which I think gives a more complete look, and feel, of the app.

## Thanks!

Best, Mads Cordes
